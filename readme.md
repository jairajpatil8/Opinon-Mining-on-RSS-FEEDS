Since the emergence of Covid-19, people’s perspectives on various things in their surroundings and online social media have significantly changed. A few examples include articles, websites, blogs, messages, postings, news channels, and web content. The behavior of reading the news online has gained popularity and is becoming a routine for certain people. Sentiment analysis, often known as opinion mining, refers to using computational linguistics, content analysis, and natural language processing to identify and isolate subjective data in source materials. Opinion mining can be seen in many sectors, such as online reviews, news feeds, and social networking. Sentiment analysis places a strong emphasis on categorizing textual information into categories that are positive, negative, and neutral. There are excellent opportunities to retrieve more news articles than ever, thanks to the technology driving Really Simple Syndication (RSS) feeds. Contrary to these technological advancements, the human ability to read all these news articles has not improved. This work introduces a visual analytics platform for performing sentiment analysis of massive news streams to fill this shortfall. The study automatically fetches and analyses RSS feeds for positive and negative opinion words and classify them to provide effective visualization.
